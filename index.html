<h2>
Causes
</h2>
<ol style="font-size:20px" >
<li>
Pollution-Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.
</li>
<li>
deforestation-Deforestation refers to the decrease in forest areas across the world that are lost for other uses such as agricultural croplands, urbanization, or mining activities.
</li>
<li>
energy wastage- energy wastage basicly is overcomsumption of energy mainly due to exces usage of gadgets.
</li>
<li>
water wastage-Approximately, a leaking faucet can waste 4,000 drops of water, which is equal to a litre of water. A flush of the toilet uses six and a half gallons of water. On an average one person wastes about 0-45 litres water per day.
</li>
<li>
plastic-Chemicals added to plastics are absorbed by human bodies. Some of these compounds have been found to alter hormones or have other potential human health effects. Plastic debris, laced with chemicals and often ingested by marine animals, can injure or poison wildlife

<h2>
Effects
</h2>
<ol style="font-size:20px" >
<li>
Habitat destruction-because of hardly any trees all the life that was living there would be homeless hence there habitat would be destroyed
</li>
<li>
Droughts-because of the burning heat the soil is drying up hence causeing major droughts
</li>
<li>
Less energy- because we all are using all the energy other citys arent getting a suficiat amount of it.
</li>
<li>
water shortage-because some of us use water very mindlessly most of the world is suffering with water shortage.
</li>
<li>
Medical issues- because of the amount of polutents in our environment alot of people are getiing sick some are also dying due to lung cancer and other lung problems

<h3>
What Can you do to reduce global warming
</h3>
<ol style="font-size:20px" >
<li>
Plant tree
</li>
<li>
Switch to renewable energy.
</li>
<li>
Don't use plastic products.
</li>
<li>
Buy energy efficient products.
</li>
<li>
Carpool
</li>
</ol>
<h4>
What if the earth gets warmer?
</h4>
<ol style="font-size:20px" >
<li>
If the earth gets warmer by 4 degrees we will be  looking at a vastly changed planet. Ice would have  vanished, rainforests would become deserts and rising seas levels would reach deep into continents. Its going to be extremely hard to grow crops in the hot weather. Racial conflicts and civil wars are the inevitable outcome.

<h5>
Facts
</h5>
<ol style="font-size:20px" >
<li>
The Arctic is one of the worst places to be affected by global warming.
</li>
<li>
The Arctic ice is melting rapidly. By 2040 the region is expected to have a completely ice-free summer or even earlier.
</li>
<li>
Sea levels have risen about 7 inches in the last 100 years, which is more than the previous 2000 years combined. The rising sea levels due to global warming could threaten the lives of people living along with the coastal areas.
</li>
<li>
As per NASA, “the global average surface temperature rose 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.1 to 1.6° F) between 1906 and 2005, and the rate of temperature increase has nearly doubled in the last 50 years. Temperatures are certain to go up further.”
